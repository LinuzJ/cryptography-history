# WIP

Plan is to create an interactive walkthrough of all the famous ciphers and algorithms

# History of Cryptography

![Build Status](https://github.com/zaszi/rust-template/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

After reading the fascinating book [_The Code Book_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17994) by Simon Singh I got inspired and decided to implement all of the relevant old ciphers in this little project.

It's meant to be an easy walkthrough showing how the ciphers progressively gets more complex.

## Usage

Choose to either follow a chronological order or the different cryptography algorithms, or jump straight to one specific.

# Build and Run

```
cargo run
```
